# iPTMs
Workflow for open-search IP-MS,  data

## Data
Each of the analysis in the manuscript 'Peptidoform analysis of IP-MS data allows detection of differentially present bait proteoforms' (HRAS, KRAS, BRD4) involves raw PSM output from MSFragger Open Search (present in releases) searched with a fasta file (in releases).
Following the respective scripts for each of the 3 case studies, the follow files are produced (present in Datasets) for input to SAINTexpress.
-Normalised peptidoform PSMs
-Forw and rev peptidoform
-interaction files
-prey files
